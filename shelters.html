      <h3>About cat shelters</h3>
      <p>
    Cat shelters are usually run by a group of volunteers. 
    They take in abandoned cats from feral cat populations.<br> 
    Also people who have to give up their cat for some reason can bring in their cats.
    In a cat shelter volunteers take care of the cats and <br> make sure they have plenty of water and food. <br>
    If a cat is ill they take it to the vet. <br> Veterinary bills are usually the biggest expense in a cat shelter. <br>
    Feral cats often have respitory illnesses caused by various viruses. <br>
    All cats are also dewormed and vaccinated <br> before they can start searching for a new home.<br>
    Only few cat shelters are lucky enough to get support from the municipality. <br>
    Most cat shelters have to survive on donations <br> and funds collected through fund raising events.
